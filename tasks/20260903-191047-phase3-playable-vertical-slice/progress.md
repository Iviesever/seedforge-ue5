# SeedForge Phase 3 Progress

## Current status

- Active PACT: PACT-31 — pure deterministic gameplay model, RED complete.
- Branch: `feat/phase3-playable-vertical-slice`.
- Base: `9a306f8ff72cb660d3c04b09806787df21191d45`.
- Last committed HEAD: `83e76727ea19e1683d8111b48de05ccb610076b9`.
- Production behavior changes: none; PACT-31 currently contains only API contracts and deliberate RED stubs.
- Blockers: none.
- Next action: commit the PACT-31 RED contract, implement the smallest GREEN encounter planner, pathfinder, and run-state behavior, then run focused and full regression.

## Risks

- Collision and input behavior must be proven in both ordinary and offscreen packaged modes; Editor Automation alone is insufficient.
- Gameplay classes increase standalone plugin target surface, so BuildPlugin remains a mandatory early integration gate after PACT-32.
- Runtime screenshots are asynchronous; the smoke state driver must own explicit screenshot completion/timeout semantics rather than rely on arbitrary sleeps.
- Encounter identity is new and independent; any change to existing layout hashes is a blocker.

## Time status

Feature freeze is 2026-09-05 13:00 (UTC+8). No scope degradation is currently required.
